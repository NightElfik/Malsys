==== SQL 2008 express problems =================================================
Quck fix to wide variety of problems, delete directory:
C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Microsoft SQL Server Data\SQLEXPRESS
If file/dir is in use, kill appropriate taks using task manager.

Sometimes two SQL servers are installed, first SQL 2008 installed with Visual
Web Developer and second by Web Platform Installer with R2. VS will incorrectly
use the older (2008) instead of 2008 R2 and error woth incopatible versions
661/655 will occur. Uninstall SQL 2008 and install 2008 R2 with Web Platform
Installer. Then delete SQLEXPRESS dir from AppData (qucik fix).
