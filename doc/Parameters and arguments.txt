These two terms are sometimes loosely used interchangeably; in particular, "argument" is sometimes used in place of "parameter". Nevertheless, there is a difference. Properly, parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls.

A parameter is an intrinsic property of the procedure, included in its definition. For example, in many languages, a minimal procedure to add two supplied integers together and calculate the sum total would need two parameters, one for each expected integer. In general, a procedure may be defined with any number of parameters, or no parameters at all. If a procedure has parameters, the part of its definition that specifies the parameters is called its parameter list.

By contrast, the arguments are the values actually supplied to the procedure when it is called. Unlike the parameters, which form an unchanging part of the procedure's definition, the arguments can, and often do, vary from call to call. Each time a procedure is called, the part of the procedure call that specifies the arguments is called the argument list.
