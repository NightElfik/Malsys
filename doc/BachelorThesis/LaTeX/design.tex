\chapter{Design}

In this chapter is described design of solution and explained decisions that were made.
Implementation details are described in Chapter \ref{chap:implementation}.

In the first section is described design of \lsystem processing library.
Library process input with component-based approach.
Core of the library is responsible for creating system of connected components (components graph) but processing of \lsystem itself is fully under control of components.
Components can be created by user which bring freedom to \lsystem processing.

Library it will contain predefined components to be possible to process \lsystems without need of creating custom components.
Design of these components is described in the second section.
These components will also serve as an example for users who want to implement their own processing system.

In the third section is described design of online web user interface.
It uses library and components to process input so it will also serve as an example of usage.
