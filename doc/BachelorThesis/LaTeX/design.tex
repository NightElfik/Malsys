\chapter{Design}

In this chapter is described design of solution and explained decisions that were made.
Implementation details are described in \autoref{chap:implementation}.

In the first section is described design of \lsystem processing library.
Library process input with component-based approach.
Core of the library is responsible for creating system of connected components (components graph) but processing of \lsystem itself is fully under control of components.
Components can be created by user which bring freedom to \lsystem processing.

Library it will contain predefined components to be possible to process \lsystems without need of creating custom components.
Design of these components is described in the second section.
These components will also serve as an example for users who want to implement their own processing system.

In the third section is described design of online web user interface.
It uses library and components to process input so it will also serve as an example of usage.


\section{Choice of development environment}

As development environment was chosen the .NET framework because of following reasons.

\begin{description*}
	\item[Multiplatformity]
		Thanks to the Mono project\footnote{Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework (\url{http://www.mono-project.com}).}
			.NET libraries and executables can be used not only on Windows but also on Linux, Mac and many other operating systems.
	\item[Development tools]
		Visual Studio 2010 is powerful integrated development environment (IDE) with many integrated tools (like inteli-sense, NuGet package system or T4 templates) and useful downloadable plugins.
		Visual Studio has built-in support for unit testing which helps to test especially non-runnable code like libraries easily.
		\nomenclature{IDE}{integrated development environment}
		\nomenclature{T4}{text template transformation toolkit}
	\item[Reflection]
		Reflection is the ability to examine types and work with meta-data, properties and functions of an object at runtime.
		Reflection can be used to load various plugins or data at runtime and help extensibility in great way.
	\item[Parser generator]
		FsLex and FsYacc are lexer and parser generators written in F\# with good support by Visual Studio.
		Generated lexer and parser are also in F\# thus they can be easily used in any .NET project.
	\item[Web framework]
		ASP.NET MVC is a lightweight presentation framework for creating web applications in .NET.
		ASP.NET MVC 3 is using the Razor view engine which helps to do the web very easily.
		\nomenclature{MVC}{model-view-controller (design pattern)}
	\item[Database and object mapping]
		MsSQL server offers to create database stored as a file directly in the application folder.
		Access to the database can be done using ADO.NET Entity Framework (EF) which can do an object-relational mapping (ORM) of the database.
		\nomenclature{MsSQL}{Microsoft SQL (server)}
		\nomenclature{SQL}{structured query language}
		\nomenclature{EF}{Entity framework}
		\nomenclature{ORM}{object-relational mapping}
