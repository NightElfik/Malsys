\noindent
The F\# PowerPack is a collection of libraries and tools for use with the F\# programming language provided by the F\# team at Microsoft.
PowerPack includes F\# versions of these lexer and parser generation tools (FsLex and FsYacc), along with MSBuild tasks to incorporate them in the build process.

The FsLex and FsYacc are used for parsing of input.


\section{HTML5 boilerplate}
\label{sec:HTML5boilerplate}
\srcurl{http://html5boilerplate.com/}

\noindent
HTML5 Boilerplate is the professional frontend developers's base HTML/CSS/JS template for a fast, robust and future-safe site.

It was used as cornerstone of HTML and CSS in the web user interface.


\section{Three.js}
\label{sec:ThreeJs}

\noindent
Three.js is lightweight JavaScript 3D library (3D engine) for rendering 3D scenes directly in web browser.

It is used to render 3D models produced by the \hyperref[Malsys.Processing.Components.Renderers.ThreeJsSceneRenderer3D]{\emph{ThreeJsSceneRenderer3D}} component.


\section{jQuery}
\label{sec:jQuery}

\noindent
jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.

All custom JavaScript win web user interface was written with the help of jQuery.


\section{Modernizr}
\label{sec:Modernizr}

\noindent
Modernizr is an open-source JavaScript library that helps you build the next generation of HTML5 and CSS3-powered websites.

Cool HTML5 and CSS3 features can be used in web user interface thanks to Modernizr.


\section{Code Contracts}
\label{sec:CodeContracts}
\srcurl{http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/}

\noindent
Code Contracts provide a language-agnostic way to express coding assumptions in .NET programs.
The contracts take the form of preconditions, postconditions, and object invariants.
Contracts act as checked documentation of your external and internal APIs.
The contracts are used to improve testing via runtime checking, enable static contract verification, and documentation generation.

Code Contracts are used in many methods across all projects.
Contract checking is turned on while solution is built on debug settings but because of performance reasons they are turned off in release.

In Source code \ref{cs:contracts} are defined four preconditions checking validity of arguments and two postconditions ensuring output format.
From contracts is clear that method must be supplied with at least 3 points in list and number of returned indices will be divisible by 3 (without reminder).
It makes sense because every 3 indices specifies a triangle.



\begin{Csharp}[label=cs:contracts,caption={Example of code contracts in the \emph{Triangularize} method of the \emph{Polygon3DTrianguler} class.}]
public List<int> Triangularize(IList<Point3D> points,
		Polygon3DTriangulerParameters prms) {
		
	Contract.Requires<ArgumentNullException>(points != null);
	Contract.Requires<ArgumentNullException>(prms != null);
	Contract.Requires<ArgumentException>(points.Count >= 3);
	Contract.Requires<ArgumentException>(
		prms.TriangleEvalDelegate != null);
		
	Contract.Ensures(Contract.Result<List<int>>() != null);
	Contract.Ensures(Contract.Result<List<int>>().Count % 3 == 0);

	...	
}
\end{Csharp}
